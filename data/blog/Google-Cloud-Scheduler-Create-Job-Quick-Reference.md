Google Cloud has a cloud based CRON job system which is highly scalable and resilient so you do not have to build it yourself. Here is a quick guide on how to use it.

First, let's start with the CRON scheduling. Even with <https://cron.help> it is hard to know how to set the time correctly, so here is a cheat sheet to get you started:

-   Every Minute: `* * * * *`
-   Every 5 Minutes: `*/5 * * * *`
-   Every 15 Minutes: `*/15 * * * *`
-   Every 30 Minutes: `*/30 * * * *`
-   Every Hour: `*/60 * * * *`
-   Every Day at 6:30 AM: `30 6 * * * *`
-   Every Day at 5:30 PM: `30 17 * * * *`
-   Monthly on the 1st at 5:30PM: `30 17 1 * *`

The first step is to go into the Google Cloud Console and enable the service. This is required before you do anything. 

Then, you can set up a job via console or CLI.  

Here is how you set it up via the console ðŸ‘‰ [Creating and configuring cron jobsÂ  |Â  Cloud Scheduler Documentation (google.com)](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/creating#console)

Using the gcloud CLI is here, but it is a bit complex: [gcloud scheduler jobs create httpÂ  |Â  Cloud SDK Documentation (google.com)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/scheduler/jobs/create/http)

To make this easy here is a simple command to use to get the majority of it working:

```yaml
gcloud scheduler jobs create http {name_goes_here} --schedule="{cron_schedule}" --uri="{url_to_hit_when_ran}" --http-method="post" --headers="Content-Type=application/json,User-Agent=Google-Cloud-Scheduler" --time-zone="America/Los_Angeles"
```

-   {name_goes_here} - any name you want to use
-   {cron_schedule} - any of the examples above such as "* * * * *" for every minute

Easy to use and something you no longer have to manage. Here is a quick loom to help also ðŸ“º [here](https://www.loom.com/share/f4b53639b63f4a8d8846b4cd24101dcf).
