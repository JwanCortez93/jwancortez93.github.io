Great blog post from Tammer Saleh on the number one trait for a developer: [http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/the-number-one-trait-of-a-great-developer/](http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/the-number-one-trait-of-a-great-developer/)

The only thing I would wonder about here is that the definition of a rock star is usually their experience + their ability. Without judgement I doubt you would have a rock star as experience comes from having good judgement and making the right decision. Ability uses judgment to figure out really what should be learned and focused on.

Here are some of the traits that I always look for in a developer to define them as a rock star:

- Experience
- Leadership
- Problem Solving
- Team focused
- Hard worker
- Passionate

Just a short list that I see as a developer can be a really good coder but in the end to become a rock star it is the list above that makes it happen.
