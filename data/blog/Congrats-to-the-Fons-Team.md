As an investor, I'm thrilled to announce that Fons, a startup that provides small to medium businesses with an easy scheduling and billing platform, is being acquired by Make Music, the largest music teacher platform around.

Fons has been hard at work for the last 7 years building something truly amazing. Their platform makes it easy for businesses to schedule appointments and manage billing, freeing up time and energy to focus on what they do best.

Now, as part of the Make Music family, Fons will be able to reach even more businesses and continue to make a positive impact on their operations. It's a win-win for everyone involved.

As we reflect on the journey of building Fons, there are a few key lessons that stand out that we believe can benefit other founders.

First and foremost, it's essential to focus on the customer. We've found that tools like FullStory, Intercom, and working directly with customers have been invaluable in helping us understand their needs and pain points. By putting the customer at the center of everything we do, we've been able to build a product that truly resonates with them.

We also learned that it's okay to try different models to see what works. When we first started out, we experimented with a free model, but we quickly learned that without a monetary commitment it slowed down conversion as each provider needed to migrate their clients. This taught us the importance of finding a pricing strategy that works for both the customer and the business.

Finally, we learned that building a platform to scale is easier now than it's ever been. A decade ago to make something scalable and highly available it took an army of operations, data center understanding, and architectural planning. Now, with modern cloud architecture we were able to build a scalable platform with a small team. This is a testament to the power of modern cloud infrastructure and the tools that are available to us today.

I want to personally congratulate Eric, Troy, Kyle, Mica, and Jenn on this exciting new chapter. Their hard work and dedication has paid off and I can't wait to see what the future holds for them.

As an investor and founder, I've seen firsthand the ups and downs of startup life. It's a rollercoaster ride that can be exhilarating, but also filled with challenges and setbacks.

But one thing I've learned is that building something from nothing takes time. It requires patience, persistence, and a lot of hard work.

The Fons team exemplifies this. Over the last 7 years, they've poured their hearts and souls into creating a product that helps small to medium businesses thrive. And today, all of their hard work has paid off.

So to all the founders and entrepreneurs out there, keep going. It won't always be easy, but the rewards of building something truly amazing are well worth the journey.
